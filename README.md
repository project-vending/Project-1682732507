#  Real-time monitoring and analysis of social media activity using Streamlit and FAST APIThis project would involve developing a real-time social media monitoring and analysis tool using Streamlit and FAST API. The application would be integrated with various social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to collect real-time data on trending topics, hashtags, mentions, and user interactions. The collected data would be processed and analyzed using statistical algorithms and machine learning models. The application would also include a dashboard to visualize insights and patterns in the data.To complete this project, you would need to set up Docker containers for Streamlit and FAST API. You would also need to configure a database, such as AWS RDS, to store and retrieve the data. Finally, you would need to deploy the application on AWS using any of the available deployment methods like Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or ECS.
